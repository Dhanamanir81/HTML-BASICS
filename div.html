      <h3>Sri Dharukavaneswarar Temple</h3>
      <p> In ancient times, this region is believed to have been densely covered with “Parai” trees. The
         Shivalingam of this temple was found among the Parai trees and this temple was later built around 
         it. This temple’s “sthala viruksham” is also the Parai tree. Generally, the names of temples that 
         are located on river banks end with “Thurai”. Following this tradition, as this temple is situated
          on the banks of the river Kaveri, it gets the name Paraithurai. </p>
